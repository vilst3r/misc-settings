* Remote Development

** Setup Instructions (from Google VM)
   1. Set up SSH keypair in "~/.ssh"
   2. Upload public SSH key to Cloud Provider
   3. SSH into VM instance to cache authorization in "~/.ssh/known_hosts"
      - "ssh -i <private-ssh-key> <username>@<host-ip>"
   4. SSH out of the VM & SCP the following directories
      - dotfiles
        - "scp -r <dotfiles-dir> <username>@<host-ip>:"
      - misc-settings
        - "scp -r <misc-settings-dir> <username>@<host-ip>:"
   5. Run "<misc-settings-dir>/remote-config/ubuntu_debian_vm_setup.sh" to
      install all necessary system binaries
   6. Copy over dotfiles into the home repository & source them for use, also:
      - Remove the '[url=<url>] section in .gitconfig as that breaks GitHub API calls
        in the VM
   7. Lastly, configure $PATH variable in your bash settings to include
      "~/.local/bin" (may be different on other cloud instances)
   8. (Optional) Install any necessary packages from pyp in "<misc-settings-dir>/pyp-leaves"

** LSP Server Setups
*** CCLS (C++)
    1. Building CCLS from source
       - command:
       #+begin_src bash
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt install -y clang cmake libclang-dev llvm-dev rapidjson-dev
       #+end_src
    2. Download CCLS source through Git
       - command:
       #+begin_src bash
       git clone --depth=1 --recursive https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls
       cd ccls
       #+end_src
    3. Build CCLS with CMake
       - command:
       #+begin_src bash
       cmake -H. -BRelease
       cmake --build Release
       #+end_src
*** PyRight (Python)
    1. Install npm & run the following:
       - command:
       #+begin_src bash
       npm install pyright
       #+end_src

** Notes
*** For emacs, ensure:

**** In iTerm, map special control sequences to escape sequences

**** In emacs, bind incompatible keybindings to those escape sequences
