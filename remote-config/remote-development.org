* Remote Development

** Setup Instructions (from Google VM)
   1. Set up SSH keypair in "~/.ssh"
   2. Upload public SSH key to Cloud Provider
   3. SSH into VM instance to cache authorization in "~/.ssh/known_hosts"
      - "ssh -i <private-ssh-key> <username>@<host-ip>"
   4. SCP the following directories
      - dotfiles
        - "scp -r <dotfiles-dir> <username>@<host-ip>:"
      - misc-settings
        - "scp -r <misc-settings-dir> <username>@<host-ip>:"
   5. Run "<misc-settings-dir>/remote-config/ubuntu_debian_vm_setup.sh" to
      install all necessary system binaries
   6. Copy over dotfiles into the home repository & source them for use
   7. Lastly, configure $PATH variable in your bash settings to include
      "~/.local/bin" (may be different on other cloud instances)
   8. (Optional) Install any necessary packages from pyp in "<misc-settings-dir>/pyp-leaves"

** Emacs

*** Setup Notes

**** Map special control sequences to escape sequences in the terminal keymapper

**** In emacs, bind incompatible keybindings to those escape sequences

**** Evil-mode doesn't work with ESC key problems

*** Python Environment Issues

**** Elpy won't work properly with proper xref-indexing, need the following:
     - "pip install virtualenv -user", the binary is located in "~/.local/bin"
       which is required in $PATH from the setup instructions
     - Apply (setq elpy-rpc-python-command "python3") for Elpy to use it's own
       python 3 virtualenv which includes jedi, black and all the packages
       needed for development
     - Most of the issue should be resolved if elpy-config works

** Vim

*** No complications so far
